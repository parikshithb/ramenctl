## Overview

How to test if disaster recovery works in my clusters? Deploying and configuring
clusters for disaster recovery is complicated. The system has many moving parts
and many things can go wrong.

The best way to verify that the system is configured correctly is to deploy a
simple application and test real disaster recovery flow. The *ramenctl* command
makes this task easy.

> [!TIP]
> When working with ODF clusters, use the `odf dr` command instead of `ramenctl`.

## Environment

For disaster recovery you must have a hub cluster and 2 managed clusters,
configured for Regional DR.

> [!NOTE]
> The `ramenctl` tool is not compatible yet with metro DR.

## Preparing a configuration file

This section describes how to prepare a configuration file for your clusters
and run a disaster recovery test.

`ramenctl` uses a configuration file to access the clusters and the related
resources needed for testing. To create the configuration file run:

```bash
$ ramenctl init

✅ Created config file "config.yaml" - please modify for your clusters
```

The command creates the file `config.yaml` in the current directory. We need to
edit the file to adapt it to our clusters.

### Configure clusters

Edit the `clusters` section and update the kubeconfig to point to the kubeconfig
files for your clusters:

```yaml
clusters:
  hub:
    kubeconfig: mykubeconfigs/hub
  c1:
    kubeconfig: mykubeconfigs/primary-cluster
  c2:
    kubeconfig: mykubeconfigs/secondary-cluster
```

### Configure drPolicy

Edit the `drPolicy` section to match your DR configuration

```yaml
drPolicy: dr-policy-1m
```

> [!TIP]
> For quicker test, use a policy with 1 minute internal.

### Configure clusterSet

Edit `clusterSet` to match your OCM configuration:

```yaml
clusterSet: default
```

### Configure pvcSpecs

Edit the `pvcSpecs` section to use the right storage class names for your
clusters. For drenv environments, use the defaults created by `ramenctl init`:

```yaml
pvcSpecs:
- name: rbd
  storageClassName: rook-ceph-block
  accessModes: ReadWriteOnce
- name: cephfs
  storageClassName: rook-cephfs-fs1
  accessModes: ReadWriteMany
```

> [!TIP]
> You can add more pvcSpecs for testing other storage classes as needed.
> Modify the test to refer to your own pvcSpec names.

### Configuring tests

The default tests use a busybox deployment with one *PVC* using *rbd* storage
class, deployed via *ApplicationSet*. You can modify the test to use your
preferred deployment and storage, and add more tests as needed.

The name of the deployer should match the deployer name in the deployers
section.

The available options are:

- workloads
  - `deploy`: busybox deployment with one PVC
- deployers
  - `appset`: OCM managed application deployed using *ApplicationSet*.
  - `subscr`: OCM managed application deployed using *Subscription*.
  - `disapp`: OCM discovered application deployed by the test command.`
- pvcSpecs:
  - `rbd`: *Ceph* *RBD* storage
  - `cephfs`: *CephFS* storage

## Running a test

This section shows how to run a test and inspect the test report.

We will run a test and store the test report in the directory `ramenctl-test`:

```console
$ ramenctl test run -o ramenctl-test
⭐ Using report "ramenctl-test"
⭐ Using config "config.yaml"

🔎 Validate config ...
   ✅ Config validated

🔎 Setup environment ...
   ✅ Environment setup

🔎 Run tests ...
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" deployed
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" protected
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" failed over
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" relocated
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" unprotected
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" undeployed

✅ passed (1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped)
```

To clean up after the test use the [clean](#cleaning-up) command.

### The test report

The command stores `test-run.yaml` and `test-run.log` in the specified output
directory:

```console
$ tree ramenctl-test
ramenctl-test
├── test-run.log
└── test-run.yaml
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When reporting DR related issues, please create an archive with the
> output directory and upload it to the issue tracker.

### The test-run.yaml

The test-run.yaml is a machine and human readable description of the the
test run:

```yaml

### The test-run.log

The `test-run.log` contains detailed logs of the test progress.

To extract single test major events use:

```bash
grep -E '(INFO|ERROR).+appset-deploy-rbd' ramenctl-test/test-run.log
```

Example output

```console

```

## Cleaning up

To clean up after a test, removing resources created by the test, run:

```console
$ ramenctl test clean -o ramenctl-test
⭐ Using report "ramenctl-test"
⭐ Using config "config.yaml"

🔎 Validate config ...
   ✅ Config validated

🔎 Clean tests ...
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" unprotected
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" undeployed

🔎 Clean environment ...
   ✅ Environment cleaned

✅ passed (1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped)
```

The clean command adds `test-clean.log` and `test-clean.yaml` to the
output directory:

```console
$ tree ramenctl-test
ramenctl-test
├── test-clean.log
├── test-clean.yaml
├── test-run.log
└── test-run.yaml
```

## Failed tests

When a test fails, the test command gathers data related to the failed tests in
the output directory. The gathered data can help you or developers to diagnose the
issue.

The following example shows a test run with a failed test, and how to inspect
the failure.

> [!TIP]
> To emulate failing a test, scale down the `rbd-mirror` deployment on the
> primary cluster after the application reaches the "protected" state.

Running the test:

```console
$ ramenctl test run -o example-failure
⭐ Using report "example-failure"
⭐ Using config "config.yaml"

🔎 Validate config ...
   ✅ Config validated

🔎 Setup environment ...
   ✅ Environment setup

🔎 Run tests ...
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" deployed
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" protected
   ❌ failed to failover application "appset-deploy-rbd"

🔎 Gather data ...
   ✅ Gathered data from cluster "hub"
   ✅ Gathered data from cluster "secondary-cluster"
   ✅ Gathered data from cluster "primary-cluster"

🔎 Gather S3 data ...
   ✅ Gathered S3 profile "minio-on-primary-cluster"
   ✅ Gathered S3 profile "minio-on-secondary-cluster"

❌ failed (0 passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped)
```

The command stores gathered data in the `test-run.data` directory:

```console
$ tree -L2 example-failure
example-failure
├── test-run.data
│   ├── hub
│   ├── primary-cluster
│   ├── secondary-cluster
│   └── s3
├── test-run.log
└── test-run.yaml
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When reporting DR related issues, please create an archive with the output
> directory and upload it to the issue tracker.

### Inspecting gathered data

The command gathers all the namespaces related to the failed test, related
cluster scope resources such as storage classes and persistent volumes, and
S3 data stored by ramen for the failed applications.

```console
$ tree -L3 example-failure/test-run.data
example-failure/test-run.data
├── hub
│   ├── cluster
│   │   └── namespaces
│   └── namespaces
│       ├── argocd
│       └── ramen-system
├── primary-cluster
│   ├── cluster
│   │   ├── namespaces
│   │   ├── persistentvolumes
│   │   └── storage.k8s.io
│   └── namespaces
│       ├── ramen-system
│       ├── argocd
│       └── test-appset-deploy-rbd
├── secondary-cluster
│    ├── cluster
│    │   ├── namespaces
│    │   ├── persistentvolumes
│    │   └── storage.k8s.io
│    └── namespaces
│        ├── ramen-system
│        ├── argocd
│        └── test-appset-deploy-rbd
└── s3
    ├── minio-on-primary-cluster
    │   └── test-appset-deploy-rbd
    └── minio-on-secondary-cluster
        └── test-appset-deploy-rbd
```

Change directory into the gather directory to simplify the next steps:

```console
$ example-failure/test-run.data
```

We can start by looking at the *DRPC*:

```console
$ cat hub/namespaces/argocd/ramendr.openshift.io/drplacementcontrols/appset-deploy-rbd.yaml
...
status:
  actionStartTime: "2025-04-01T18:02:06Z"
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-01T18:02:41Z"
    message: Completed
    observedGeneration: 2
    reason: FailedOver
    status: "True"
    type: Available
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-01T18:02:06Z"
    message: Started failover to cluster "secondary-cluster"
    observedGeneration: 2
    reason: NotStarted
    status: "False"
    type: PeerReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-01T18:03:11Z"
    message: VolumeReplicationGroup (test-appset-deploy-rbd/appset-deploy-rbd) on
      cluster secondary-cluster is not reporting any lastGroupSyncTime as primary, retrying
      till status is met
    observedGeneration: 2
    reason: Progressing
    status: "False"
    type: Protected
  lastUpdateTime: "2025-04-01T18:08:11Z"
  observedGeneration: 2
  phase: FailedOver
  preferredDecision:
    clusterName: primary-cluster
    clusterNamespace: primary-cluster
  progression: Cleaning Up
```

We can see that the application is stuck in "Cleaning Up" progression and the
*VRG* in cluster "secondary-cluster" is not reporting `lastGropSyncTime` value.

Looking at the *VRG* in cluster in cluster "secondary-cluster":

```console
$ cat secondary-cluster/namespaces/test-appset-deploy-rbd/ramendr.openshift.io/volumereplicationgroups/appset-deploy-rbd.yaml
...
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-01T18:02:48Z"
    message: PVCs in the VolumeReplicationGroup are ready for use
    observedGeneration: 2
    reason: Ready
    status: "True"
    type: DataReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-01T18:02:37Z"
    message: VolumeReplicationGroup is replicating
    observedGeneration: 2
    reason: Replicating

    type: DataProtected
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-01T18:02:37Z"
    message: Restored 0 volsync PVs/PVCs and 2 volrep PVs/PVCs
    observedGeneration: 2
    reason: Restored
    status: "True"
    type: ClusterDataReady
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-01T18:02:47Z"
    message: Cluster data of all PVs are protected
    observedGeneration: 2
    reason: Uploaded
    status: "True"
    type: ClusterDataProtected
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-01T18:02:37Z"
    message: Kube objects restored
    observedGeneration: 2
    reason: KubeObjectsRestored
    status: "True"
    type: KubeObjectsReady
  kubeObjectProtection: {}
  lastUpdateTime: "2025-04-01T18:12:48Z"
  observedGeneration: 2
  ...
```

We can see that DataProtected is False.

Looking at the *VR* resource in the same namespace:

```console
$ cat secondary-cluster/namespaces/test-appset-deploy-rbd/replication.storage.openshift.io/volumereplications/busybox-pvc.yaml
...
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-01T18:02:48Z"
    message: volume is promoted to primary and replicating to secondary
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Promoted
    status: "True"
    type: Completed
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-01T18:02:48Z"
    message: volume is healthy
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Healthy
    status: "False"
    type: Degraded
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-01T18:02:47Z"
    message: volume is not resyncing
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: NotResyncing
    status: "False"
    type: Resyncing
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-01T18:02:47Z"
    message: volume is validated and met all prerequisites
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: PrerequisiteMet
    status: "True"
    type: Validated
  lastCompletionTime: "2025-04-01T18:12:48Z"
  message: volume is marked primary
  observedGeneration: 1
  state: Primary
```

We see that the VR is primary and replicating to the other cluster.

We can also inspect ramen-dr-cluster-operator logs:

```console
% tree secondary-cluster/namespaces/ramen-system/pods/ramen-dr-cluster-operator-5dd448864d-78x8l/manager/
secondary-cluster/namespaces/ramen-system/pods/ramen-dr-cluster-operator-5dd448864d-78x8l/manager/
├── current.log
└── previous.log
```

In this case the gathered data tells that ramen is not the root cause, and we
need to inspect the storage.

If more information is needed you can use the standard must-gather with OCM
images to do a full gather.

When we finished to debug the failed test we need to cleanup up:

```console
$ ramenctl test clean -o example-failure
⭐ Using report "example-failure"
⭐ Using config "config.yaml"

🔎 Validate config ...
   ✅ Config validated

🔎 Clean tests ...
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" unprotected
   ✅ Application "appset-deploy-rbd" undeployed

🔎 Clean environment ...
   ✅ Environment cleaned

✅ passed (1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped)
```

## Canceling tests

The run or clean command may take up to 10 minutes to complete the current test
step. To get all the information about failed tests you should wait until the
command completes and gathers data for failed tests.

You can cancel the command by pressing `Ctrl+C`. This saves the current tests
progress but does not gather data for incomplete tests.
